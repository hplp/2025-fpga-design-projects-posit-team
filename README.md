## Project Title:
(Posit - Index-based computation of real-number multiplication)

## Project Description:
(We propose to develop a custom intellectual property (IP) core for performing Multiply-
Accumulate (MAC) operations where the activation inputs are in 16-bit IEEE floating-
point format (FP16), and the weights are in 4-bit posit (Posit4) format. This IP will be
developed on the PYNQ-Z1 FPGA board, either using Verilog RTL or High-Level Synthesis
(HLS). The goal is to combine the advantages of industry-standard FP16 activations with
the low-precision posit representation for weights, thereby reducing resource usage while
maintaining reasonable accuracy for real-number MAC operations. This IP aims to support
computational tasks common in machine learning and high-performance computing)
